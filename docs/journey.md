# Journey

## Token spec follows BoardUI (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** the owner wanted to "overhaul how plumber suggests and looks for tokens"; the system it proposes today does not scale to large apps.
- **How we found it:** the owner shared BoardUI's typography and colour pages (docs/references.md).
- **The system behind it:** plumber names type roles Material-style with weight baked into each role, and colour roles as flat short names (`fg`, `muted`, `surface`) with no room for states, levels, charts or a rebrand-by-one-colour.
- **What we chose and why:** keep plumber's reading of a page into roles; change what it lands on. Type: 13 named steps × 4 weights, one class per pair, colour separate. Colour: primitives, semantic `--color-{category}-{role}-{state}`, optional component tokens, dark mode in one block, accent ramp from one colour. Our own rules stay (APCA guard, one accent, status keeps meaning).
- **The fix and the proof:** spec only so far: docs/design/token-spec.md. Nothing built.
- **Media hooks:** a before/after of crafting-ui's text sizes snapped onto the ladder, once layer 1 is built.

## Type ladder, layer 1 (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** plumber's text styles used Material names with weight baked in ("title-medium"), which do not scale; the owner chose BoardUI's ladder (token spec, entry above).
- **How we found it:** building layer 1 of docs/design/token-spec.md and running it on crafting-ui's measured text.
- **The system behind it:** snapping each text element to the nearest of 13 fixed sizes and 4 weights makes every rare size × weight its own style: 31 styles on crafting-ui's 403 measured places, where the old engine gave 8.
- **What we chose and why:** a style needs 3 places to stand alone; fewer joins the nearest kept style (a weight step costs 1, a size step 2). A fluid hero keeps its clamp only when most of its places are fluid. Line-height and tracking come from the ladder, not the code.
- **The fix and the proof:** live on crafting-ui (`POST /__plumb/system`, project scope): 21 styles, text sizes 35 → 9, weights 6 → 4, 423 places, 12 rare styles folded. On the same 403 measured places as the old dry run: 20 styles, sizes 34 → 11 (old: 8 roles, 34 → 8).
- **What it costs:** 98 places are "low confidence" (old engine: 39), mostly prose whose line-height (1.5–1.6) the ladder's UI leading (16/22 = 1.375) would tighten by more than 3px, and lead paragraphs at 18–20px.
- **Media hooks:** the clean-up text panel listing "Headline", "Title 3 semibold", "Caption 2 caps" with the before → after sizes.

## Prose keeps its leading (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** the ladder would squeeze crafting-ui's reading paragraphs from 1.5–1.6 line-height to the ladder's UI leading (about 1.375); 98 places were "low confidence".
- **What we chose and why:** the owner picked a prose modifier over loosening the ladder: the ladder stays exact for UI text, and reading text gets one extra class, `leading-prose`, with one shared value. A place is prose when its code sets a line-height of 1.45 or more, at 20px or smaller, not caps.
- **The fix and the proof:** live on crafting-ui (`POST /__plumb/system`): 137 places marked prose at 1.5 (the most common value in the code); low-confidence places 98 → 34, the rest now being display headings whose size moves more than 2px. Example swap: `text-[1.1875rem] leading-[1.6]` → `text-title-2-regular leading-prose`.
- **Owner's call:** prose reads at 1.6, not the code's 1.5; written in crafting-ui's plumber config (`prose: { lineHeight: 1.6 }`), replacing its old Material-named decisions. Low-confidence places 34 → 32.

## First real write of the type ladder (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** the new text styles had only been proposed, never written into an app.
- **How we found it:** applied plumber's write to a side copy of crafting-ui (a git worktree on port 5181, so the main checkout's uncommitted work stayed untouched), then read computed styles on /motion/standards and compared screenshots.
- **What broke first:** applied straight from source (no measured page), uppercase labels lost their letter-spacing (0.88px → 0.2px). The cause: reading only the classes on an element misses uppercase and tracking inherited from a parent, so a caps label looked like plain caption text, and its new class overrode the inherited spacing.
- **What we chose:** write only from a measured census (`plumber census --url …`, then the project-scope proposal), which reads computed values and so sees inheritance. That is how the product's own clean-up flow already works. Also: code blocks (`pre`, `code`, `kbd`) never count as prose.
- **The fix and the proof:** census of 60 routes → 22 styles, sizes 34 → 12, 163 caps places, 101 prose places at 1.6. Write: 28 tokens, one CSS block, 279 swaps in 34 files. Computed on /motion/standards: caps labels 11px / 0.88px uppercase; prose 20px/32px, 16px/25.6px, 14px/22.4px; headings 18px/24px semibold.
- **Media hooks:** before/after screenshots of / and /motion/standards on the side copy.

## Big files refused the write (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** 3 of crafting-ui's 34 files refused the type write with "Replacement text must be at most 500 characters."
- **The system behind it:** all of a file's class swaps are written as one change, and its history label joins every new class name; a limit meant for text a person types fired on that label, not on any code change.
- **The fix and the proof:** the label lists each distinct value once and is cut to fit (`… (N in all)`). Re-applied on the side copy: 78 swaps in the 3 files, 0 refused; nothing left pending for the project.

## Page titles: tight and up to 48px (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** 46 places would change a lot under the ladder, mostly page titles.
- **How we found it:** listing every title-sized place with its current values: the titles were flagged for line-height more than size. crafting-ui sets them tight (about 1.04); BoardUI's display leading (about 1.33–1.375) would open a 46px title by about 13px per line. Page titles also used two fluid sizes, topping out at 44px (11 pages) and 48px (8 pages).
- **What the owner chose:** a tight ladder (display steps 32px and up at about 1.1: 64/70, 56/62, 48/53, 40/44, 32/36) over a heading modifier or BoardUI's numbers; and fluid titles up to 48px. The second became a rule, not a setting: a fluid style keeps the clamp whose top is nearest its ladder size (48px is exactly Display 2).
- **The fix and the proof:** re-written on the side copy: 22 styles, sizes 34 → 12, low-confidence places 46 → 20, 74 writes with none refused. /motion/standards at 1280 wide: the h1 is `text-display-2-medium`, 46.08px on 50.9px lines.

## Open gaps
- Token spec layers 2–6 not built; four owner decisions open (§6).
- e2e/type-roles.test.mjs still expects the old Material names; rewrite when the owner calls for tests.
- The clean-up text panel with the new names was not looked at in the browser.
- Writing from source without a census gets inherited caps wrong; the no-census proposal should refuse to write, or read ancestors.
- 20 low-confidence places left: one-off sizes (28–33px, 22px) that move more than 2px onto the ladder.
- The tailwind-merge trap is untested: crafting-ui does not use it.
