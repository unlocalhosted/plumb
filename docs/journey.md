# Journey

## Token spec follows BoardUI (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** the owner wanted to "overhaul how plumber suggests and looks for tokens"; the system it proposes today does not scale to large apps.
- **How we found it:** the owner shared BoardUI's typography and colour pages (docs/references.md).
- **The system behind it:** plumber names type roles Material-style with weight baked into each role, and colour roles as flat short names (`fg`, `muted`, `surface`) with no room for states, levels, charts or a rebrand-by-one-colour.
- **What we chose and why:** keep plumber's reading of a page into roles; change what it lands on. Type: 13 named steps × 4 weights, one class per pair, colour separate. Colour: primitives, semantic `--color-{category}-{role}-{state}`, optional component tokens, dark mode in one block, accent ramp from one colour. Our own rules stay (APCA guard, one accent, status keeps meaning).
- **The fix and the proof:** spec only so far: docs/design/token-spec.md. Nothing built.
- **Media hooks:** a before/after of crafting-ui's text sizes snapped onto the ladder, once layer 1 is built.

## Type ladder, layer 1 (2026-11-10)
- **The itch:** plumber's text styles used Material names with weight baked in ("title-medium"), which do not scale; the owner chose BoardUI's ladder (token spec, entry above).
- **How we found it:** building layer 1 of docs/design/token-spec.md and running it on crafting-ui's measured text.
- **The system behind it:** snapping each text element to the nearest of 13 fixed sizes and 4 weights makes every rare size × weight its own style: 31 styles on crafting-ui's 403 measured places, where the old engine gave 8.
- **What we chose and why:** a style needs 3 places to stand alone; fewer joins the nearest kept style (a weight step costs 1, a size step 2). A fluid hero keeps its clamp only when most of its places are fluid. Line-height and tracking come from the ladder, not the code.
- **The fix and the proof:** live on crafting-ui (`POST /__plumb/system`, project scope): 21 styles, text sizes 35 → 9, weights 6 → 4, 423 places, 12 rare styles folded. On the same 403 measured places as the old dry run: 20 styles, sizes 34 → 11 (old: 8 roles, 34 → 8).
- **What it costs:** 98 places are "low confidence" (old engine: 39), mostly prose whose line-height (1.5–1.6) the ladder's UI leading (16/22 = 1.375) would tighten by more than 3px, and lead paragraphs at 18–20px.
- **Media hooks:** the clean-up text panel listing "Headline", "Title 3 semibold", "Caption 2 caps" with the before → after sizes.

## Open gaps
- Token spec layers 2–6 not built; four owner decisions open (§6).
- Prose leading: the ladder's line-heights fit UI text, not reading text; 98 places on crafting-ui would tighten by >3px. Needs a prose decision.
- e2e/type-roles.test.mjs still expects the old Material names; rewrite when the owner calls for tests.
- The clean-up text panel with the new names was not looked at in the browser.
